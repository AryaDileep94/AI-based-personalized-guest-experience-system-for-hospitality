4,"One bedroom apartment with wonderful view and free, secure parking, but not close enough  to the main beach area.",23 June 2019,Sue,South Africa,9.2,"The building itself has a very musty smell in the hallway (despite being built in 1988), but the apartment itself smells good, which makes it bearable. 
When showering, the hot water goes off every 2-3 minutes for about 20-30 seconds and then only cold water comes out. The hot water then comes back again. This should be checked out. That is the only thing we didn’t like about the apartment. ,

The view was great, the apartment furnished in a modern style and equipped with everything you may need. The apartment was clean. 
There is free, secure parking outside in the building’s parking lot or downstairs in the garage.
